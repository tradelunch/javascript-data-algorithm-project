# 1. Topological Sort



There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: true
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
</strong>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
</strong><strong>Output: false
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
</strong>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites\[i] are **unique**.
