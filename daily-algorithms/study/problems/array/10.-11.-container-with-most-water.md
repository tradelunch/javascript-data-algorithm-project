# 10.  11.Â Container With Most Water

11\. Container With Most WaterMedium25.1K1.3KCompanies

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
</strong><strong>Output: 49
</strong><strong>Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: height = [1,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
